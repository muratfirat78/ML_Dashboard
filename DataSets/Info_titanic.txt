Target: Survived

Columns:

Cabin: Cabin number assigned to the passenger; may indicate socio-economic status or location on the ship.

Age: Age of the passenger (in years); age could influence survival likelihood, especially for children or elderly passengers.

PassengerId: Unique identifier assigned to each passenger; used for indexing and reference.

Survived: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive); this is the target variable.

Pclass (Passenger class): Socio-economic class of the passenger — 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class

Name: Full name of the passenger, often including title (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss); can be used to extract social status or gender.

SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard): Number of siblings or spouses the passenger had on board; reflects family group size.

Parch (Parents/Children aboard): Number of parents or children the passenger had on board; indicates family connections.

Ticket: Ticket number associated with the passenger; sometimes used to infer group bookings or fare class.
