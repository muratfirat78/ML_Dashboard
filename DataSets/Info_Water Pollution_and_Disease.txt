This dataset explores the relationship between water pollution and the prevalence of waterborne diseases worldwide. It includes water quality indicators, pollution levels, disease rates, and socio-economic factors that influence health outcomes. The dataset provides information on different countries and regions, spanning the years 2000-2025.

It covers key factors such as contaminant levels, access to clean water, bacterial presence, water treatment methods, sanitation coverage, and the incidence of diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid. Additionally, it incorporates socio-economic variables such as GDP per capita, urbanization rate, and healthcare access, which help assess the broader impact of water pollution on communities.

This dataset can be used for:

Public health research on the impact of water pollution.

Environmental studies to analyze trends in water contamination.

Policy-making for clean water access and sanitation improvements.

Machine learning models to predict disease outbreaks based on water quality.

Prevalence:
Covers 10 countries (e.g., USA, India, China, Brazil, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Mexico, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ethiopia).

Includes 5 regions per country (e.g., North, South, East, West, Central).

Spans 26 years (2000-2025).

Features 3,000 unique records representing various water sources and pollution conditions.

Features: 

Diarrheal Cases per 100,000 people (target)
Cholera Cases per 100,000 people (target)
Typhoid Cases per 100,000 people (target)
