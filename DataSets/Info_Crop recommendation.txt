Features (Inputs):

N – Nitrogen content in the soil (in mg/kg)
P – Phosphorus content in the soil (in mg/kg)
K – Potassium content in the soil (in mg/kg)
temperature – Average temperature in °C
humidity – Average relative humidity in %
ph – Soil pH value
rainfall – Rainfall in mm
Label: TARGET

This is classification task, so dop not convert the target to integer.
